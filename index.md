# Background

My abilities as a solution architect and programmer are the fruit of more than 20 years of experience in I.T. for clients and projects of various sizes in retail, B2B, B2C, online marketing, translation and inventory control, in both the private and the public sectors. 

As a full stack programmer, my experience encompasses both the frontend (design, marketing, usability, translation, HTML-CSS-JS coding and business logic) and the backend (servers, databases, code management, business logic, Python3-PHP-JS-Bash).

Speaking business fluently and having good people skill was a requirement as a small business entrepreneur. Navigating the politics of a big company as a large-scale marketing production manager made me grow fast, both professionally and in life. As a technical translator, I practiced daily the art of putting myself in another person's shoes. Forming healthy professional relationships is such an important skill when leading and motivating team members toward a common goal.
